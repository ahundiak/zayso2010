Does it make sense to create an admin bundle?

Currently have
CoreBundle

    Component
        FormType
            Admin
                Person
                    PersonEditFormType
            Person
                PersonEditFormType

    Controller
        Admin
            Person
                EditController
        Person
            EditController

     Resources
         views
             Admin
                 Person
                     edit.html.twig
                     search.html.twig

The individual person templates are found under the specific product bundles

The AdminBundle functionality would be designed to work across all the product bundles

The concern is that individual bundles might need their own additional admin functionality?

Might be best to just plow ahead with AreaBundle for now.
