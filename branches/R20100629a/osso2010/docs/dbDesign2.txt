In this design focus on mirroring eayso format as much as practical

Possible to add outside teams but minimal

  Tournament Roster - No gender, No program, No year, No team number
  Non-tournament roster - same as above
  Uniform requirements has player gender, missing asst coach id

Primary vs Fall - Major pain

Select Primary or Fall
       Primary or Spring

====================================
AYSO ID
Generated by eayso - 8 digits
Need to generate through zayso,  Keep them just numbers, make then 6 digits perhaps
Table: zayso_ayso_id, just insert a record then pull the next number

GAME ID
The team summary also generates id numbers, same trick could be employed
6 digits

Need id generator
