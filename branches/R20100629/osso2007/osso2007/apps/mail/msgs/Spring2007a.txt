Subj: [AYSO894]Monrovia Soccer Spring 2007

Hi All,

The jamborees start this Saturday, March 3rd at Westminster.  
The web site (http://localhost/ayso894/) has the details.
The jamborees are open to all players.  No registration is required.
Have the players wear shin guards and bring water.

We currently have enough coaches and referees to support the U8,U14 and U16 spring teams.
So bring the player registration forms to the jamborees along with twenty bucks.

We do not have nearly enough U10 and U12 coaches.  
I currently only have two U10 coaches and two (maybe) U12 coaches.  
You can register your U10/U12 players and bring their forms to the jamborees however
we will NOT be collecting registration money for them until we know for sure that
we have enough coaches.  If we don't get enough coaches by March 9th then we will
not have regular spring soccer for U10 and U12.  

Spring coaching is easy.  We provide training and equipment.  So please consider volunteering.

Two referee classes have been scheduled:
Class 1
Fri, March  9, 2007 6:00 P.M.- 10:00 P.M.
Sat, March 10, 2007 1:00 P.M. - 5:00 P.M.

Class 2 
Tuesday,  April 3, 2007 6:00 P.M.-10:00 P.M.
Thursday, April 5, 2007 6:00 P.M.-10:00 P.M.

Both training classes will be at Asbury Church (Hughes Rd, South of HW 72)in the hope building. 
There will be signs outside directing you to the meeting spot. Please spread the
word to anyone who is interested in attending. No sign up is necessary. Each
Class is a two day course. You must attend both days and pass the test to be
certified as a referee.

Thanks

Art Hundiak
