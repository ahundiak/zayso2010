Subj: [AYSO894]Monrovia Soccer Spring 2007

Hi All,

In spite of what the weather might suggest, spring really is just around the corner and with it comes Spring Soccer.

We have two events in Monrovia.  
Starting in March we host Saturday jamborees in which any child can show up and play soccer.  No registration required.
Starting in April, we form teams and play regular games until the end of May. Registration is required.
Details are on the web site: http://www.ayso894.org/

Important
AYSO Soccer is an all volunteer organization.  
Each Spring team needs to have a coach and a referee.  
It's easy and we provide training.
Last year I really had to twist arms to get enough coaches and we had very few referees.
This year, if we don't have enough coaches then we won't have Spring Soccer.

Please email me if you plan on coaching or being a referee this spring.

We also need help setting up goals and marking the fields at Westminster.  
We will do this on Saturday, Feb 24th starting at 9:00am.

Thanks

Art Hundiak
