ExtJS
Inclusive and mature, big

Ext.Direct for quick database interactions

YUI 3 - Not enough widgets

YUI 2
Good table and calender, like the autoload stuff, not so much config oriented
*** Select box?
AutoComplete works like it
Decent example showing autocomplete with a button

The copy/paste in data grid works okay but fields have new lines between them

jQuery
Light weight and popular core library

Need to select best of breed components
saw a nice grid and calendar

UI DatePicker
http://jqueryui.com/home

jqGrid
http://trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html

jquery.json - convert to json

ajaxupload - file uploads

=================================
Tested
calendar
file uploads

TODO
Combo boxes
Basic grids

=================================
How hard would it be to pull in Ext.Direct and Ext.Stores?
