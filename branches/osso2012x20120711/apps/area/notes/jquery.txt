Using latest jquery 1.7.1
Customized ui 1.8 with just date picker.

Tried the stand alone date pick to reduce file size but had some issues.
Doc also seems poor though jquery is in the process of rebuilding their plugin database.

Tried ui-lightness, didn't really care fo the orange and had problems with default zayso.css
flick seems to work okay.

The assetic stuff simply does not work well with libraries.  The css image paths don't seem to work.

However, using the assets:install to just copy the stuff over works fine.

Another advantage of using jquery ui is that it's easy to build a custom library with just the necessary components.

Also learning how to use a javascript block to put all the javascript at the bottom of the page.
