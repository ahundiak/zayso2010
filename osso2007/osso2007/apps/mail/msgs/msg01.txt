Subj: [AYSO894]Monrovia Soccer Registration, Sat, June 10th

Hi All,
The second registration for Monrovia/Harvest AYSO Fall 2006 soccer will be held this
Saturday, June 10th, at the Monrovia Church of Christ (corner of Nance and Capshaw)
from 9:00am to 2:00pm.

Details can be found here: http://ayso894.org/index.php/registration
Be sure to bring a signed copy of each player form as well as a check
made out to AYSO 894 to the registration.

We could use some help at registration.  Just show up if you have the time.

WE NEED FIELDS!
Our program is growing and we may end up losing a couple of key fields this year.
We need to develop some new fields and need help in locating them.
If your church, school or other organization has open fields then please let us know.
And if you happen to be willing to donate 30 acres or so of flat land 
then we would name the soccer park after you.

Thanks

Art Hundiak
