#summary ArrayObject Notes

= Background =

It's nice to be able able to switch between object and class notation.
The PHP ArrayObject implements an alarming number of interfaces but one would
think that it's still the fastest way to go.

Want a controlled means of converting to json.

Expect to have Cerad_Direct_Result implement ArrayObject

The PHP_ArrayObject does not allow returning a default value for undefined properties

Cerad_Array will.
