#summary Person Schema Information

= Background =

The basic goal is to have a person table with one entry for each person in the system.
Two basic categories of persons, players and the rest (coaches, referees, managers, volunteers) etc.
The same person can be both a player as well as a volunteer.  Might have some trouble linking
volunteer records with their player record.
