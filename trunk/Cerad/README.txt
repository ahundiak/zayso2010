This time I used the SVN Tortoise to create a folder called Cerad in the zayso2010 repo.
I then created a netbeans project called Cerad and then this readme file.
All under Windows 7 64-bit

Looks like net beans subversion is active.  Try a check in.
Still not finding an svn executable.
Need a command line client.

Installed 64-bit version of SlikSvn
