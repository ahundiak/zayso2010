<h3>Social Networking (Google,Facebook,Twitter etc.) Accounts</h3>
<p>
  One of the problems with sites like Zayso is that it is all too easy to forget your user name and password.
  Recovering passwords and such is just no fun at all.  However, you can now link your Zayso account to one or
  more social networking accounts such as Facebook.  Once linked, you can sign in to Zayso by clicking on the
  Facebook icon.  No more having to remember your Zayso information.<br />
</p>
Click on the icon(below) of the site you wish to link to Zayso.  You can link multiple sites if you wish.
Zayso never sees the password of the social networking site.
You will always be redirected to the social site itself before being asked for a password.
You should also be aware that some sites indicate that Zayso can update your information.
Zayso does not in fact have the ability to update any information on the social sites.
</p>
<p>
If you do not wish to use one of the common sites then use the myOpenID icon.
This is a very generic account management site with the usual password recovery features.
<a href="http://www.myopenid.com/">Click here to create an account on myOpenID</a> then link it to Zayso.
