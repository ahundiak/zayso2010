Subj: [AYSO894]Monrovia Soccer Registration, Sat, May 13th

Hi All,
The first registration for Monrovia/Harvest AYSO Fall 2006 soccer will be held this
Saturday, May 13th, at the Monrovia Church of Christ (corner of Nance and Capshaw)
from 9:00am to 2:00pm.

Details can be found here: http://ayso894.org/index.php/registration
Be sure to bring a signed copy of each player form as well as a check
made out to AYSO 894 to the registration.

We could use some help at registration.  Just show up if you have the time.

Thanks

Art Hundiak
