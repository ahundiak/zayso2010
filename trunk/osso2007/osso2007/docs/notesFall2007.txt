Took a break from about March 2007.  Worked okay during the Spring though did not have many games.

Need to:
1. Update to ZF 1.0

2. Think I need to move authentication to the controllers themselves.
Some are admin only
Some are public
Some are member only

Reduce it to a simple if (!isAuth()) return

3. Need to handle different types of views

SchedDivTpl
  Web
  Excel
  PDF
  
Controller does need to change but want different template classes.
SchedDivTplexcel
SchedDivTplpdf
SchedDivTplweb

Looks a bit strange but would work
SchedDivTplExcel
SchedDivTplPdf
SchedDivTplWeb

Looks better 

Do not want controller dceiding view class, only the template thats needed
Have a base in my notes but not sure about that.
Possible that the main view class would check the output type then create a new
view class to just to handle it.  However, in most cases I would expect the view
classes to be just about the same.

4. Better directory layout?

PhyTeam/SchTeam should probably be TeamSch/TeamPhy
FieldSite could be Fieldsite or just site
On the other hand, it really is fine as it goes.
