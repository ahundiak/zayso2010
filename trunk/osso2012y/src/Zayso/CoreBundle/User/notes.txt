Spent a day going over the 2.1 security code.  Understand the auth system a bit better.

Still not sure about the default system for handling people not signed on.  Save it for 2.2

The user provider can handle aysoid/email as well as openid.  Not sure if it is the best design or not.

The encoder handles the master password just fine.

The existing auth code is pretty strange and requires passwords and such.  Might be better to just implement my own.
