  2 club

person - fname,lname,dob etc

  person_reg osso,ayso,ussf
    person_id - optional
    reg_num - registration number
    contact info (phone,email)

  person_reg_cert osso referee or ayso_advanced
  person_reg_org

player vs volunteer - deal with later

From original exported person table, add link to person_reg for any aysoid, leave rest blank
