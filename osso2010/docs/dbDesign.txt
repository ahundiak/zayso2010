  category - referee, coach etc
  badge - advanced etc

Let's assume that the person database is by itself

Want to be able to maintain individual copies of the various certification source databases
without necessarily bringing them all into the master person database

When signing up to referee an ayso games, the person should be
1. Up to date volunteer
2. certified referee
3. certified safe haven

In either ayso or osso database?

person
  ayso_person
  osso_person

The osso people are added manually to deal with people wo have not yet been entered in ayso
The osso id will eventually be replaced with ayso id record

person
  person_cert_group
    ayso  8 digit id
    osso  8 digit generated id
    ussf  whatever they use

Look in ayso or osso, in theory we don't want overlaps between the groups

org
  cert - yes or no if it issues certification
  keyx - OSSO AYSO USSF etc

org_cert
  Just the organizations that issue some sort of certification
  keyx - AYSO,OSSO,USSF,NFHS
  org_id - ther master organization list

person
  person_org
    One record for each organization they are certified by
    person_id
    org_cert_id
    org_cert_idx - Unique identification for the organization
    year_membership  Assume that all members need to reapply each year
    name_first
    name_last
    name_middle
    name_nick
    phone_home

person_org_cert Actual certs a person has
  person_id
  person_org_cert_id
  org_cert_id

  cert_category
  cert_badge
  cert_date
  cert_datex  Recertification date if needed




When dealing with ayso, use the ayso if present otherwise use osso

The person table might just be a unique list of person_ids
Information about each person will be stored under the person_organization
Each person will always have an osso record

person
  person_org
    person_org_cert

To find referees, link down to person_org_cert possibly filtering by certification organization type and year

Person can belong to osso and ayso

Within ayso a person can belong to one of more regions
org
  AYSO Certification
  AYSO Region 894
  AYSO Region 498

person
  One record for each person

person_org
  AYSO
  AYSO Region 894
  AYSO Region 498
  OSSO

Teams belong to an organization such as AYSO region 894

The AYSO record should be the master
person_org_region

A master organization can contain a nested set of organizations
AYSO
  Section
    Area
      Region

Info from the AYSO record needs to filter down, one level should be enough
person_org_sub - active or inactive

There should be one sub record for each region a person is associated with
This is just for querying
The status will be used to disable a link to a given organization

Permissions would be linked to person_org_sub record
RRA in one region could be Coach administrator in another

org
  keyx AYSO R0894
  keyx AYSO A05C
  keyx AYSO S08

org_reg
  Certification organizations type = cert or player
  Regigistration organizations
  AYSO Volunteer
  AYSO Player

org_group
  Groups of organization

org_group_org
  Members of the organization group

person         - one unique record for each person
person_org     - membership year, also contains org_reg id to account for player
person_org_sub - specific regions, active or not, possibly have the year here as well?
person_org_cert
person_org_phone
person_org_email

The interesting problem will be when have osso as well as ayso records
Eventually want to resolve them
But could start with a fresh database with only ayso folks in it

Players are people as well

Person
  volunteer
  player

Different id numbers and registration tracking

org
  org_id
  keyx   AYSO NAT, AYSO R0894, OSSO

org_reg
  org_reg_id
  org_id
  org_reg_type_id  Player or Certification

org_group
org_group_org

person
  person_id
  fname
  lname
  nname
  mname
  suffix
  gender
  dob
  status

person_org
  person_org_id
  org_reg_id - Always have OSSO record
  person_id
  fname,lname
  email,phone - person_org_email, person_org_phone

person_org_sub
  person_org_sub_id
  person_org_id
  org_sub_id    Points to org table, region specific info

person_org_cert
  person_org_cert_id
  person_org_id
  cert_cat
  cert_type
  cert_date
  active

person
person_org - Link to one or more regions
person_org_reg - Registered for ayso etc
person_org_reg_cert - Certifications for that organization

====================================
Following this approach implies that importing from eayso has to be done directly in to osso
Really do no have the luxury of individual databases anymore
But that is basically what is happening now anyways

Want only ayso referees, query against person_org then link in the master osso information
