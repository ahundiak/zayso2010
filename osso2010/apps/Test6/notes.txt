The original design had different files under web (index/direct/jsload) all of which called individual
FC files to do the work.

The new design has a single web/index.php which directly loads a master front controller.

The front controller itself uses $_GET arguments to decide what to execute in turn

index.php jsload=file (No file means to load defaults set of files)
index.php a=action (Last check, allows debugging individual actions, default to index)

The original code figured out the base web path and worked from it, for now using relative paths
