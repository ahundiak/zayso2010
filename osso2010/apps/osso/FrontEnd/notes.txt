Front Controller Design

Possible inputs

  _GET
  _POST
  _COOKIES
  _REQUEST = contains all three

Normally one want to access this information from a context object but do we always want to create a context?

index.php loads in FE_FC

FE_FC extends Cerad_FE_FC
  sets include path and class loader
  creates context
  context->request->get('c')
  $routeClassName = $context->routes->get($c)
  new $routeClassName($context)->execute()

Front End functions
  css-load
  js-load
  direct
  extjs
  classic

FE_LoadCSS
FE_LoadJS
FE_Direct

The front controller hands off control to a front end processor
Overload the mean of 'c' in this case

How to distingush between extjs request and classic?

The only extjs generic request would be the index page?

index.php
  APP_CONFIG_FE classic or extjs
  wonder if wrapping all the app config parameters in an array and passing it along would be better?

rt = request type
  css  f=
  js   f=
  direct
  extjs - really the same as html
  html (default)

ra = action
  index-classic or index-extjs
  account-create
  account-show

rm = action method
  execute
  create
