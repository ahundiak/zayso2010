Loading teams.  Using the team summary results in multiple hits for a dozen or so names.

But did find at least one record, could do is to import the roster and use as an update to get the correct id.
Want to use the summary to get the team id.

Doing that might result in some duplicate person records getting created if the wrong record was selected.

Tournament followed by summary is the only way to be sure and to get the id's.

Or else summary without person information.  That would at least get the teams in.

=========================
Question: Do I need osso records if I have a eayso record and nothing has changed?
As long as a merge is being done then probably not.
Have to see how the queries work out.

More person cleanup

Have some aysoid that are older than FS2008 and no certifications.  Those are being skipped.

Have other aysoid that are simply not in eayso

Looked up each of the names in person and added in aysoid when found.

Still have about 300 open slots but those are mostly old.
