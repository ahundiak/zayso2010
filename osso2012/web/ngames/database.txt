Should we maintain account-member?

account           account_id uname upass
member  member_id account_id fname lname nname email cell_phone

person person_id fname lname nname email phone aysoid

If the aysoid exists then create account-member-person entry
If it does not exist then???

person_guid - guid person_id confirmed grade years
  person_id aysoid
  person_id ussfid
  person_id arbiteremail
  person_id nfhsid

Pretty sure want to keep using person_id as master

For national/section games, creating an account will always create account-member-person-person_guid

An account will always have at least one member

Create an account collect: uname upass aysoid region_number email phone fname lname nname

  account => aname apass
  member  => fname lname nname email phone region_number - person_guid

  person  => fname lname nname email phone region_number - person_guid - dob gender

Still have the nagging issue of multiple regions for a user
Support it in the eayso database.
For zayso, only one region allowed

Should we always create a person record?
account
account_person (many to many) account_id person_id primary confirm
person
person_guid person_id guid type (ayso) badge years

Eliminate the duplication between member and person
Later on could break out guid from person
=======================
project_person_role - attend, ref, coach, volunteer etc

person_player - person_id player_guid type (me, child, sibling, family, other)

project_person_crew person_id person_id (all crew members must be registered)
project_person_age_groups_to_ref with confirmation
project_person_lodging
