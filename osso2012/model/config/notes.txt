Need to better intergrate model and app stuff

model
  Entities
    NatGames
      DataItem - generic data class
      EntityItem - base class
      EntityRepo - base class
      UserItem - Not really an item, user
    S5Games
    Area5CF
    Zayso
    OSSO2012
    AYSO
    Arbiter
  Proxies
  config
  process
  tests
  testsNS
  sql

Part of it is wanting to share stuff among the various apps without tying them too close together

OSSO2012 could act as base class

Cerad
  ClassLoader model and app
  DataItem
  Debug
  Request
  Response
  Import
  EchoSQLLogger
  Services

  FrontEnd
    Action
    View
    FrontCont
  Format
    HTML
  Reader
    CSV


repos are probably app specific.

Cerad\FrontEnd\Action
NatGamesApp\FrontEnd\Action
NatGamesApp\Home\HomeAction

App\FrontEnd
  Action
  View

  FrontCont
  FrontContWeb

  PageTpl.html.php

  Services
  User

add base directory to model and apps

how about config?
Had pretty good luck with just pulling in model\config
