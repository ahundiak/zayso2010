  <h1>STORM Schedules Changes</h1>
  <p style="padding: 10px;">
    As most of you probably know, the final round of games did not get played on Saturday.
    The tournament committee is presently reconfiguring the Sunday schedule.
    Most of the time slots will stay the same but some teams will change.
    I don't expect a new schedule to be posted till very late.  I will probably not update zayso at all.
    It will stay off line until further notice.

  <p style="padding: 10px;">
    Referees: The best I can say is show up early on Sunday and we will start handing out assignments.
    Many of you still have kids playing.  We will work around the issues one game at a time.
    There will be plenty of games for everyone.
    And remember, this is fun.

    Referee information has not yet been added.  Stay tuned.

    If you already have an account then sign in below.
